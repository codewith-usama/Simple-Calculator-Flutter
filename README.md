# calculator

A new Flutter project.

This project allowed me to learn and utilize several important concepts in app development. I wanted to share some of my key takeaways from this experience with you all.

Here are some of the highlights from my project:

- I included a splash screen to give my app a professional and polished feel right from the start.

- I used the Flutter Math Expression package to execute expressions with a context model, which allowed me to perform complex calculations with ease.

- To display the results of my calculations, I utilized tables and table rows to create an organized and easy-to-read interface.

Overall, this project was a fantastic learning opportunity for me. It allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge in a practical way, while also gaining experience with new tools and techniques.
